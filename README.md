# odin-recipes

Introduction
This project will outline a few of my favourite recipes as a showcase of what I've learned so far in my brief foray into HTML development.
This project is from The Odin Project and it will be following the guidelines it lays out to complete.
This will not be a "pretty project" however my goal is to provide a means of proof of what I have learned, and a reflection for my future self on where I started.
